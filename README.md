  <summary>How to calculate the vapor pressure deficit (VPD)</summary><br>
  
  * Calculate the actual VPD with measured temperature and humidity inside your growbox. <br>  
  * Leaftemperature is controlled by `0_userdata.0.GrowBoxes.GrowBox_1.VPD_1.VPDLEAFCORRECTION`.<br>In my case 9% - 11% under room temperature seems to work well.<br>
